          <p>
            My name is Rashidah, and I am a frontend developer who enjoys
            creating clean, accessible, and user-friendly web interfaces. I love
            solving problems with code and learning new ways to make digital
            experiences more engaging.

          <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
          <p>
            My goal in this program is to grow as a frontend developer by
            improving my understanding of modern tools, frameworks, and best
            practices. I want to strengthen my problem-solving skills, build
            complete and responsive user interfaces, and become more confident
            in writing clean, maintainable code. I also hope to connect with
            like-minded learners and mentors, expand my professional network,
            and learn from others‚Äô experiences. Through collaboration, feedback,
            and consistent effort, I aim to develop both technical and personal
            skills that will prepare me for real-world projects and career
            growth.

          <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes I hesitate when faced with unfamiliar problems or complex
            logic. I‚Äôm still building confidence in debugging and explaining my
            code clearly, but I‚Äôm learning to trust the process, practice
            patience, and celebrate small wins along the way.

            <p>Dear Future Rashidah,</p>
            <p>
              Keep going even when things get tough. Remember how far you have
              come and how much you have learned along the way. Stay curious,
              stay patient, and never stop improving yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              When challenges arise (and they will), don't forget why you
              started. You love creating. You love solving problems. You love
              the feeling of building something from nothing and watching it
              come to life in a browser.
            </p>

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm grateful for every chance to learn and improve. Each project
            helps me grow, and I look forward to becoming a better version of
            myself with every new challenge.
